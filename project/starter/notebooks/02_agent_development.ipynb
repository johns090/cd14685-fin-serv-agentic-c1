    "\n",
    "### STEP 1: DATA REVIEW\n",
    "- Extract and document all relevant transaction details (amounts, frequency, timing, parties involved)\n",
    "- Identify account holder information and behavioral baseline\n",
    "- Identify relationships between different data entities\n",
    "- Note any unusual patterns or deviations from normal activity\n",
    "- Flag any red flags in customer profile or transaction metadata\n",
    "- **Output**: Structured summary of key facts\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEP 2: PATTERN RECOGNITION\n",
    "- Analyze transaction timing and frequency patterns\n",
    "- Examine transaction amounts and progressive escalation/de-escalation\n",
    "- Identify beneficiaries and transaction counterparties\n",
    "- Look for structuring patterns (round amounts, just-below-threshold amounts)\n",
    "- Check for layering or circular transaction patterns\n",
    "- **Output**: List of identified patterns with confidence levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEP 3: REGULATORY MAPPING\n",
    "- Map identified patterns to regulatory red flags (31 CFR 1010.320)\n",
    "- Consider jurisdictional compliance requirements\n",
    "- Identify applicable BSA/AML filing thresholds and triggers\n",
    "- Cross-reference with sanctions list indicators\n",
    "- **Output**: Mapping of activities to regulatory requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEP 4: RISK QUANTIFICATION\n",
    "- Assess likelihood of illicit intent (Low/Medium/High)\n",
    "- Evaluate financial impact and AML/CFT risk exposure\n",
    "- Consider customer risk profile and beneficial ownership structure\n",
    "- Calculate overall risk score (0-100)\n",
    "- **Output**: Quantified risk metrics with justification\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEP 5: CLASSIFICATION DECISION\n",
    "- Based on all evidence, determine primary classification category\n",
    "- Provide alternative classifications if applicable\n",
    "- Explain confidence level in primary classification\n",
    "- State any mitigating or aggravating factors\n",
    "- **Output**: Final classification with reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification Categories\n",
    "- **Structuring**: Deliberate splitting of deposits/withdrawals to avoid reporting thresholds\n",
    "- **Sanctions**: Activity involving sanctioned jurisdictions, entities, or individuals\n",
    "- **Fraud**: Deceptive financial activity or identity misrepresentation\n",
    "- **Money_Laundering**: Integration of illicit funds into legitimate financial system\n",
    "- **Other**: Activity requiring investigation but not fitting primary categories\n",
