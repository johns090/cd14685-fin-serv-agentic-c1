    "# 🔗 Workflow Integration - Complete SAR Processing System\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Phase 4 of the Financial Services Agentic AI Project!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll integrate both AI agents into a complete **end-to-end SAR processing workflow** that demonstrates real-world financial compliance automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Build a complete two-stage AI workflow with human oversight\n",
    "- Implement human-in-the-loop decision gates for compliance\n",
    "- Generate complete SAR documents from AI analysis\n",
    "- Create comprehensive audit trails for regulatory examination\n",
    "- Demonstrate cost optimization through intelligent agent coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Business Context\n",
    "This workflow simulates how banks actually process suspicious activity reports:\n",
    "1. **Risk Screening**: AI agents analyze transaction patterns for suspicious activity\n",
    "2. **Human Review**: Compliance officers review AI findings before proceeding\n",
    "3. **Narrative Generation**: Only approved cases get full compliance documentation\n",
    "4. **SAR Filing**: Complete regulatory forms are generated for submission\n",
    "5. **Audit Documentation**: Every decision is logged for regulatory examination\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "📊 CSV Data → 🔍 Risk Analyst → 👤 Human Decision → ✅ Compliance Officer → 📄 SAR Document\n",
