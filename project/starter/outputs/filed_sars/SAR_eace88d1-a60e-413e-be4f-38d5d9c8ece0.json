Unusually high average transaction amounts and multiple wire transfers raise suspicion.\n\n            # Step 2 - Pattern Recognition:\n            # The patterns identified include frequent large wire transfers and significant inflows with no outflows, suggesting potential structuring and money laundering activities.\n\n            # Step 3 - Regulatory Mapping:\n            # Applicable Regulations: 31 CFR 1010.320\n\n            # Step 4 - Risk Quantification:\n            # Risk Score: 85/100\n            # Likelihood of Illicit Intent: High\n\n            Step 5 - Classification Decision:\n            The analysis reveals strong indicators of money laundering, including structuring through frequent wire transfers and significant inflows without corresponding outflows. The high-risk nature of the activity and the potential impact warrant a classification of money laundering.\n            "
